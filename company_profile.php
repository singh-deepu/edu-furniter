					<p>Our collaborative approach and ability to change and adapt to project diversities ensures we create great outcomes for our clients. Our team is made up of an eclectic and talented group of highly skilled individuals. Together, we apply these skills to realise meaningful outcomes that are vivid and versatile. Our Team One of the many points of difference between Edu Furnitures and our competitors is that the personnel you meet on day one are actively involved until the end of the project. Secondly, since we have our own production and manufacturing team, we do much better customisation compared to mere importers and assemblers<p>
					<p><b>SCHOOL FURNITURE DESIGNING in India</b></p>
					<p>Edu Furnitures gives considerable thought to the design ofthe modern classrooms, labs, library, cafeteria, hostel etc for any given school. We apply Thought Leadership to every project and collaborate closely with our clients to understand and develop their continually-evolving aspirations and emerging trends. School Furniture Design is about more than just providing an environment in which students and teachers come to do work. Instead, it is about creating a ‘Sense of place’ for schools, their teachers and students, their staff members that suits their needs, defines both their professional and personal values and that allows them seamlessly to transition between both. We design the project on CAD/CAM before getting into the nitty gritties of customisation in terms of production. Custmisation is carried out at the design stage itself that seamlessly flows through the production and installation.</p>
